    <p>
      This document provides readers with an understanding of how to use <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2</a></cite> [<cite><a class="bibref" data-link-type="biblio" href="/about/#bib-wai-aria" title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA) 1.1">WAI-ARIA</a></cite>] to create accessible rich internet applications.
      It describes considerations that might not be evident to most authors from the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> specification alone and recommends approaches to make widgets, navigation, and behaviors accessible using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> roles, states, and properties.
      This document is directed primarily to Web application developers, but the guidance is also useful for user agent and assistive technology developers.
    </p>
    <p>This document is part of the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> suite described in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Overview</a>.</p>

        <section id="intro">
    <h2 id="x1-introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>This section is <em>informative.</em></p>
    <p>
      <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Authoring Practices is a guide for understanding how to use
      <cite><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> 1.2</a></cite> to create an accessible Rich Internet Application.
      It provides guidance on the appropriate application of <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, describes recommended <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> usage patterns, and explains concepts behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Languages used to create rich and dynamic web sites, e.g., HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and SVG, do not natively include all the features required to make sites usable by people who use assistive technologies (AT) or who rely on keyboard navigation.
      The <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Web Accessibility Initiative's (WAI) Accessible Rich Internet Applications working group (ARIA WG) is addressing these deficiencies through several <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> standards efforts.
      The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/aria.php"><abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> Overview</a>
      provides additional background on <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr>, summarizes those efforts, and lists the other documents included in the <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Applications">WAI-ARIA</abbr> suite.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a brief <q>Read Me First</q> section, the guide begins with ARIA implementation patterns for common widgets that both enumerate expected behaviors and demonstrate those behaviors with working code.
      The implementation patterns and examples refer to detailed explanations of supporting concepts in subsequent guidance sections.
      The guidance sections cover more general topics such as use of ARIA landmarks, practices for keyboard interfaces, grid and table properties, and the effects of role <code>presentation</code>.

      <p>
        Functionally, ARIA roles, states, and properties are analogous to a CSS for assistive technologies.
        For screen reader users, ARIA controls the rendering of their non-visual experience.
        Incorrect ARIA misrepresents visual experiences, with potentially devastating effects on their corresponding non-visual experiences.
      </p>
      <p>Before using ARIA or any of the guidance in this document, please take time to understand the following two essential principles.</p>
      <h3 id="principle-1-a-role-is-a-promise">Principle 1: A role is a promise</h3>
      <p>This code:</p>
      <pre><code aria-busy="false" class="hljs xml">
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">role</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"button"</span>&gt;</span>Place Order<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span>
          </code></pre>
      <p>
        Is a promise that the author of that <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> has also incorporated JavaScript that provides the keyboard interactions expected for a button.
        Unlike HTML input elements, ARIA roles do not cause browsers to provide keyboard behaviors or styling.
      </p>
      <p>Using a role without fulfilling the promise of that role is similar to making a "Place Order" button that abandons an order and empties the shopping cart.</p>
      <p>One of the objectives of this guide is to define expected behaviors for each ARIA role.</p>
      <h3 id="principle-2-aria-can-both-cloak-and-enhance-creating-both-power-and-danger">Principle 2: ARIA Can Both Cloak and Enhance, Creating Both Power and Danger</h3>
      <p>
        The information assistive technologies need about the meaning and purpose of user interface elements is called accessibility semantics.
        From the perspective of assistive technologies, ARIA gives authors the ability to dress up HTML and SVG elements with critical accessibility semantics that the assistive technologies would not otherwise be able to reliably derive.
      </p>
      <p>Some of ARIA is like a cloak; it covers up, or overrides, the original semantics or content.</p>
      <pre><code aria-busy="false" class="hljs javascript">
        &lt;a role=<span class="hljs-string">"menuitem"</span>&gt;Assistive tech users perceive <span class="hljs-built_in">this</span> element <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> an item <span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> a menu, not a link.&lt;/a&gt;
        <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">aria-label</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"Assistive tech users can only perceive the contents of this aria-label, not the link text"</span>&gt;</span>Link Text<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre>
      <p>On the other hand, some uses of ARIA are more like suspenders or belts; they add meaning that provides essential support to the original content.</p>
      <pre><code aria-busy="false" class="hljs xml">
        <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">button</span> <span class="hljs-attr">aria-pressed</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"false"</span>&gt;</span>Mute<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">button</span>&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This is the power of ARIA.
        It enables authors to describe nearly any user interface component in ways that assistive technologies can reliably interpret, thus making components accessible to assistive technology users.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also the danger of ARIA.
        Authors can inadvertently override accessibility semantics.
      </p>
      <pre><code aria-busy="false" class="hljs xml">
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">table</span> <span class="hljs-attr">role</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"log"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!--
      Table that assistive technology users will not perceive as a table.
      The log role tells browser this is a log, not a table.
    --&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">table</span>&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">ul</span> <span class="hljs-attr">role</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"navigation"</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- This is a navigation region, not a list. --&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"uri1"</span>&gt;</span>nav link 1<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"uri2"</span>&gt;</span>nav link 2<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-comment">&lt;!-- ERROR! Previous list items are not in a list! --&gt;</span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>&gt;</span>

      <p>
        <strong>Testing assistive technology interoperability is essential before using code from this guide in production.</strong>
        Because the purpose of this guide is to illustrate appropriate use of ARIA 1.2 as defined in the ARIA specification, the design patterns, reference examples, and sample code intentionally <strong>do not</strong> describe and implement coding techniques for working around problems caused by gaps in support for ARIA 1.2 in browsers and assistive technologies.
        It is thus advisable to test implementations thoroughly with each browser and assistive technology combination that is relevant within a target audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, JavaScript and CSS in this guide is written to be compatible with the most recent version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari at the time of writing.
Some JavaScript and CSS may not function correctly in Internet Explorer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except in cases where the ARIA Working Group and other contributors have overlooked an error,
        examples in this guide that do not function well in a particular browser or with a specific assistive technology are demonstrating browser or assistive technology bugs.
        Browser and assistive technology developers can thus utilize code in this guide to help assess the quality of their support for ARIA 1.2.
      </p>

        <section id="mobile_and_touch_support">
      <h2 id="x2-3-mobile-and-touch-support">Mobile and Touch Support</h2>
      <p>
        Currently, this guide does not indicate which examples are compatible with mobile browsers or touch interfaces.
        While some of the examples include specific features that enhance mobile and touch support, some ARIA features are not supported in any mobile browser.
        In addition, there is not yet a standardized approach for providing touch interactions that work across mobile browsers.
      </p>
      <p>More guidance about touch and mobile support is planned for future releases of the guide.</p>
