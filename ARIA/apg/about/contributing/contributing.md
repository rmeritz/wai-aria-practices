      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Testing examples for WCAG compliance</li>
        <li>Reviewing and editing example documentation</li>

        <li>Creating and editing patterns of aria usage</li>

      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/aria-at/">ARIA and Assistive Technologies Community Group</a> is testing the implementation of assistive technology support for ARIA.  The community group also works with AT vendors to improve the consistency of how ARIA information is conveyed to users.  Results of implementation testing are integrated into the APG implementation reports.  The group meets weekly to coordinate the development of tests and testing with assistive technologies.  Members are expected to regularly attend meetings and to actively contribute to the assistive technology testing.</p>

      <h2>Other Ways to Contribute</h2>

      <h3>Raise a Github Issue</h3>
      <p>
        The APG Task Force uses github issues to manage the activities of the working group.  Creating an issue is the best way to ask a question or report problems with an example or other information in the APG.  Please review the issues list to see if your question has been asked or your problem reported.  If an issue already exists feel free to add your own comments to the issue.  New issues are reviewed in the weekly APG meetings.

      <h3>Mailing Lists</h3>

        The APG Task Force uses the public aria-practices mailing list for email discussion.
        Meeting announcements, agendas, and links to minutes are sent to the mailing list.
        While GitHub issues are the preferred place to discuss APG content, the mailing list is available to anyone who would prefer to communicate with the APG Task Force via email.
